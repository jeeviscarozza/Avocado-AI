These include exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of sleep, meditating, and taking painkillers.Logging your symptoms in an app like Flocan help you to get ahead and prepare for how you might feel, whether that’s making sure you have a hot-water bottle handy or painkillers in the house. What causes luteal phase defects? You might have heard the phraseluteal phase defectbut not be totally sure what it means. It’s sometimes used when referring toluteal phase deficiency— when your body doesn’t produce enough progesterone after ovulation to thicken and maintain the uterine lining. You might also have a short luteal phase. Although some people who experience this may struggle to conceive, many have successful pregnancies. Speak to your doctor if you have any concerns.

What does ovulation feel like? 9 ovulation signs and symptoms,https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/health/ovulation/what-is-ovulation,26 September 2023,"Every piece of content at Flo Health adheres to the highest editorial standards for language, style, and medical accuracy. To learn what we do to deliver the best health and lifestyle insights to you, check outour content review principles. What is ovulation, and how can you tell when it’s happening? Let's find out. Whether you’re trying to conceive or simply want to understand your own body better, learning about ovulation is a great place to start. But what exactly is ovulation, and what telltale signs and symptoms might your body give you that it’s taking place? Read on to find out more. Figure out when you're likely to be ovulating in the Flo app Key takeaways What is ovulation? Before we dive into ovulation signs and symptoms, let’s refresh our minds on what ovulation involves. Ovulation is a regular part of yourmenstrual cycle. During ovulation, one of your ovaries (either the left or the right) willrelease an egg. After this, the egg willtravel through a uterine tube(also known as a fallopian tube), where it may or may not befertilized by a sperm. This is where it getsreallyinteresting because what happens after ovulation depends on whether a sperm fertilizes the egg or not. If a sperm does fertilize the egg, thisfertilized eggwill move into the uterus, where it can burrow in and implant itself into the uterine lining. As you can probably guess, thisresults in a pregnancy, and you won’t ovulate again until after your pregnancy has ended. If a sperm doesn’t fertilize the egg, however, it will eventually disintegrate, and your body willshed your uterine liningthrough the vagina. This is the bleeding you know as a period. So whether you’re trying to conceive or want to understand your body better, knowing when you ovulate and how to track it, as well as some of the possible ovulation symptoms and signs, can be powerful knowledge indeed. Your cycle is so much more than your period When do you ovulate? It would be great if you couldtrack your ovulation dayslike regular days of the week. However, you only need to ask a handful of your friends about their periods to know thateveryone’s cycle is different, which means it’s rarely as straightforward as that. And, to complicate matters even further,your own cycle will varythroughout your life. But while you can’t always say for certain when you’ll ovulate each month, there are ways to make a pretty accurate prediction (phew!).Generally speaking, you’ll ovulate around14 daysbefore your period arrives. That means that in a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation will happen somewhere around the 14th day. We count the first day of your period as the first day of your cycle.But as we know, themajority of people don’t have a 28-day cycle; in fact, a normal cycle can range from21 to 35 days. So ovulation could happen either earlier or later than the 14th day, depending on the length of your cycle. You can use Flo’s handyovulation calculatorto predict when ovulation might occur based on your own cycle dates; clever, huh? How long does it last? Not long at all: themoment of ovulation itself is instant. Following this, the egg cansurvive for up to 24 hours. However, keep in mind that your fertile window (aka the time in your menstrual cycle when you’re most likely to get pregnant) is much longer than this. Peak fertility will be theday you ovulate, as well as the five days leading up to ovulation itself.Hang on. You’re fertile the five days leading up to ovulation, too? How does this happen? Well, sperm can survive in your body forup to five days after sex(yes, really), meaning you could have had sex several days before ovulation, and some sperm could have waited inside your reproductive system until the moment your egg is released. At that point, it’s perfectly possible for the sperm to fertilize your newly released egg and for a pregnancy to occur.So if you’retrying to conceive, it’s mighty useful to be aware of when your fertile window is likely to be, so you can plan accordingly. Take a quiz Find out what you can do with our Health Assistant Ovulation signs and symptoms So, how do you know when you’re ovulating? Your body might give you some guidance on figuring this one out, as you’re likely to experience a number of different telltale signs and symptomswhen ovulation is happening. Keep in mind that no two people are the same, and each person will feel these symptoms at a different degree of intensity, if at all. Let’s take a closer look below. Cervical mucus changes For starters, one of the classic signs that ovulation is happening soon is achange in your vaginal discharge(aka cervical mucus).This dischargewill be different from what you might usually see in your underwear; it will be clear and have a thinner, more slippery consistency, just likeraw egg whites. Body temperature changes After ovulation, you might also experience a smallrise in yourbasal body temperature(that’s the temperature of your body when you’re resting) of aroundhalf a degree Fahrenheit(0.3 Celsius). Intrigued and want to know how to measure it accurately? We’ll take a closer look at this later in the article. Changes in the cervix There are also somechanges that happen to your cervixduring ovulation. If you want to get to know your body better, then you can use your finger tocheck your cervix; make sure you wash your hands, and then gently insert one of your fingers into your vagina untilyou feel your cervix. You’ll notice that just during ovulation, it will behigher and feel soft. You’ll also notice that after ovulation is over, it becomes much harder again. Examining your own cervix can be tricky, of course, so if you don’t notice much of a difference, don’t worry. Most people find it easier to observe changes in cervical mucus than changes in the texture and position of the cervix. Breast soreness or tenderness The rush of hormones before and during ovulation can lead tobreast soreness and tenderness.This can rangefrommild breast painthat’s barely noticeable to severe pain that makes it uncomfortable to wear tight clothing. Don’t suffer in silence if this is affecting your day-to-day life; be sure to reach out to your doctor to discuss any possible treatment options. Pelvic or abdominal pain It’s not a myth: you might feel aslight painin the lower part of your abdomen as ovulation occurs. Remember that you’ll only feel this pain on one side, depending on which ovary has released an egg that month.You’ll probably experience this ache, known asmittelschmerz(a German word that means “middle pain” or “pain in the middle of the month”), fora couple of minutes or even days. While this might be alarming, rest assured that thepain is normaland should subside. If it doesn’t stop, and painkillers don’t help, be sure to reach out to your doctor to make sure everything is OK. Bloating Do you getbloated when you ovulate? You’re not alone. This is another typicalsymptom of ovulation, and it occurs due to the hormonal changes that are happening around this time. If it’s making you feel (understandably) uncomfortable, thenstaying hydrated and opting for smaller mealscould help. Light spotting During ovulation, you might also experience somelight bleeding or spotting. Again, this is no cause for concern, but if it lasts longer than a day or two or is particularly heavy, be sure to reach out to your doctor. Libido changes Just before ovulation, there is arise in the levels of a hormone called estrogen, and this can mean that you may start to feel moreturned onthan usual. Your libido might thendrop again after ovulationas the levels of estrogen decrease.

Nausea As if bloating, cramping, and breast soreness weren’t enough, the change in hormones during your menstrual cycle that causes pain can also causesome people to feel nauseous. If you’re affected by this, tryheading outside for some fresh airordrinking peppermint or ginger tea. How to detect ovulation Ready to figure out when you’re next going to ovulate? Let’s take a look at some of the methods available. Chart your menstrual cycle The other way you can predict ovulation is bytracking your periodsover several months using an app likeFlo. By recording the days when your period begins and ends, you can figure out your average cycle length. You can then use this information to determine when in your cycle you’re likely to ovulate, which, as we know, is around14 days before your period begins. Monitor your basal body temperature (BBT) Remember we said you might experience aslight rise in your basal body temperatureafter ovulation? Even though the rise is small, you may be able tonotice the change on a digital thermometerif you consistently track your temperature around the same time each day of your menstrual cycle, preferably first thing in the morning. However, it’s important to note that this isnot a recommended methodof birth control or an accurate way to predict ovulation if you’re trying to get pregnant, as your temperature can be affected by a number of factors, and you only see the rise in temperature after ovulation has already occurred. Ovulation kit You could also try anovulation kit, which you might also know as an ovulation test or ovulation stick. These work bymeasuring your body’s level of luteinizing hormonethrough your pee. You’ll get asurge of this hormonejust before you ovulate, so it’s a good indicator of when ovulation will occur, which is valuable information indeed if you’re trying for a baby. You usually use these kits by holding the test or stick in your pee for a set amount of time (depending on the product) and then waiting for the results to show — similar to a pregnancy test. For the most accurate results, you should try to take the test at aroundthe same time every day. Ovulation calculator Looking for an even simpler way to understand when ovulation might occur?

All you need to do is enter the first day of your last period and your average cycle length, and the calculator will crunch the numbers for you. Saliva test The saliva test is a little-known test that can sometimes (but not always) show when you’re ovulating. It works by looking atpatterns in your saliva, which might make a fern-shaped pattern during ovulation. However, this test isn’t widely used becausenot every woman’s salivamakes this shape, so the tests aren’t particularly accurate. So if you’re looking for a more accurate way of detecting ovulation, one of the other methods is likely to be more reliable. Ovulation disorders It can also be helpful to know about some of the problems with ovulation that can sometimes happen. These canimpact how regularly you ovulateand sometimes even prevent ovulation from happening: Note:Ovulation predictions should never be used for birth control. FAQs Can you feel it when you ovulate? As we’ve seen, you might feel a bit of pain,known asmittelschmerz, for a couple of minutes (or even days!) when you ovulate. This will usually be on one side of your belly, depending on which ovary released an egg. Can a man sense when a woman is ovulating? Strange but true: A man might indeed be able to sense when a woman is ovulating, although not necessarily on a conscious level.One studyfound that the scent of ovulating women could increase testosterone levels and reduce cortisol levels in men, suggesting that their bodies subconsciously respond to ovulation. Does ovulation pain mean you’re more fertile? Ovulation is a key part of the journey to getting pregnant, as a woman’s body needs torelease an eggin order for sperm to fertilize it. Therefore, ovulation itself can be an indicator of fertility, but there is no evidence to suggest that ovulation pain is a sign of increased fertility. Does ovulation make you tired and hungry?

History of updates What does ovulation feel like? 9 ovulation signs and symptoms Figure out when you're likely to be ovulating in the Flo app Key takeaways What is ovulation? Before we dive into ovulation signs and symptoms, let’s refresh our minds on what ovulation involves. Ovulation is a regular part of yourmenstrual cycle. During ovulation, one of your ovaries (either the left or the right) willrelease an egg. After this, the egg willtravel through a uterine tube(also known as a fallopian tube), where it may or may not befertilized by a sperm. This is where it getsreallyinteresting because what happens after ovulation depends on whether a sperm fertilizes the egg or not. If a sperm does fertilize the egg, thisfertilized eggwill move into the uterus, where it can burrow in and implant itself into the uterine lining. As you can probably guess, thisresults in a pregnancy, and you won’t ovulate again until after your pregnancy has ended. If a sperm doesn’t fertilize the egg, however, it will eventually disintegrate, and your body willshed your uterine liningthrough the vagina. This is the bleeding you know as a period. So whether you’re trying to conceive or want to understand your body better, knowing when you ovulate and how to track it, as well as some of the possible ovulation symptoms and signs, can be powerful knowledge indeed. Your cycle is so much more than your period When do you ovulate? It would be great if you couldtrack your ovulation dayslike regular days of the week. However, you only need to ask a handful of your friends about their periods to know thateveryone’s cycle is different, which means it’s rarely as straightforward as that. And, to complicate matters even further,your own cycle will varythroughout your life. But while you can’t always say for certain when you’ll ovulate each month, there are ways to make a pretty accurate prediction (phew!).Generally speaking, you’ll ovulate around14 daysbefore your period arrives. That means that in a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation will happen somewhere around the 14th day. We count the first day of your period as the first day of your cycle.But as we know, themajority of people don’t have a 28-day cycle; in fact, a normal cycle can range from21 to 35 days. So ovulation could happen either earlier or later than the 14th day, depending on the length of your cycle. You can use Flo’s handyovulation calculatorto predict when ovulation might occur based on your own cycle dates; clever, huh? How long does it last? Not long at all: themoment of ovulation itself is instant. Following this, the egg cansurvive for up to 24 hours. However, keep in mind that your fertile window (aka the time in your menstrual cycle when you’re most likely to get pregnant) is much longer than this. Peak fertility will be theday you ovulate, as well as the five days leading up to ovulation itself.Hang on. You’re fertile the five days leading up to ovulation, too? How does this happen? Well, sperm can survive in your body forup to five days after sex(yes, really), meaning you could have had sex several days before ovulation, and some sperm could have waited inside your reproductive system until the moment your egg is released. At that point, it’s perfectly possible for the sperm to fertilize your newly released egg and for a pregnancy to occur.So if you’retrying to conceive, it’s mighty useful to be aware of when your fertile window is likely to be, so you can plan accordingly. Take a quiz Ovulation signs and symptoms So, how do you know when you’re ovulating? Your body might give you some guidance on figuring this one out, as you’re likely to experience a number of different telltale signs and symptomswhen ovulation is happening. Keep in mind that no two people are the same, and each person will feel these symptoms at a different degree of intensity, if at all. Let’s take a closer look below. Cervical mucus changes For starters, one of the classic signs that ovulation is happening soon is achange in your vaginal discharge(aka cervical mucus).This dischargewill be different from what you might usually see in your underwear; it will be clear and have a thinner, more slippery consistency, just likeraw egg whites. Body temperature changes After ovulation, you might also experience a smallrise in yourbasal body temperature(that’s the temperature of your body when you’re resting) of aroundhalf a degree Fahrenheit(0.3 Celsius). Intrigued and want to know how to measure it accurately? We’ll take a closer look at this later in the article. Changes in the cervix There are also somechanges that happen to your cervixduring ovulation. If you want to get to know your body better, then you can use your finger tocheck your cervix; make sure you wash your hands, and then gently insert one of your fingers into your vagina untilyou feel your cervix. You’ll notice that just during ovulation, it will behigher and feel soft. You’ll also notice that after ovulation is over, it becomes much harder again. Examining your own cervix can be tricky, of course, so if you don’t notice much of a difference, don’t worry. Most people find it easier to observe changes in cervical mucus than changes in the texture and position of the cervix. Breast soreness or tenderness The rush of hormones before and during ovulation can lead tobreast soreness and tenderness.This can rangefrommild breast painthat’s barely noticeable to severe pain that makes it uncomfortable to wear tight clothing. Don’t suffer in silence if this is affecting your day-to-day life; be sure to reach out to your doctor to discuss any possible treatment options. Pelvic or abdominal pain It’s not a myth: you might feel aslight painin the lower part of your abdomen as ovulation occurs. Remember that you’ll only feel this pain on one side, depending on which ovary has released an egg that month.You’ll probably experience this ache, known asmittelschmerz(a German word that means “middle pain” or “pain in the middle of the month”), fora couple of minutes or even days. While this might be alarming, rest assured that thepain is normaland should subside. If it doesn’t stop, and painkillers don’t help, be sure to reach out to your doctor to make sure everything is OK. Bloating Do you getbloated when you ovulate? You’re not alone. This is another typicalsymptom of ovulation, and it occurs due to the hormonal changes that are happening around this time. If it’s making you feel (understandably) uncomfortable, thenstaying hydrated and opting for smaller mealscould help. Light spotting During ovulation, you might also experience somelight bleeding or spotting. Again, this is no cause for concern, but if it lasts longer than a day or two or is particularly heavy, be sure to reach out to your doctor.

Ovulation kit You could also try anovulation kit, which you might also know as an ovulation test or ovulation stick. These work bymeasuring your body’s level of luteinizing hormonethrough your pee. You’ll get asurge of this hormonejust before you ovulate, so it’s a good indicator of when ovulation will occur, which is valuable information indeed if you’re trying for a baby. You usually use these kits by holding the test or stick in your pee for a set amount of time (depending on the product) and then waiting for the results to show — similar to a pregnancy test. For the most accurate results, you should try to take the test at aroundthe same time every day. Ovulation calculator Looking for an even simpler way to understand when ovulation might occur? We hear you. Why not try ourovulation calculatorthat we mentioned earlier, too?

However, this test isn’t widely used becausenot every woman’s salivamakes this shape, so the tests aren’t particularly accurate. So if you’re looking for a more accurate way of detecting ovulation, one of the other methods is likely to be more reliable.

These canimpact how regularly you ovulateand sometimes even prevent ovulation from happening: FAQs Can you feel it when you ovulate? Can a man sense when a woman is ovulating?

References History of updates Related articles Flo App Company Content Legal Whether you’re trying to conceive or simply want to understand your own body better, learning about ovulation is a great place to start. But what exactly is ovulation, and what telltale signs and symptoms might your body give you that it’s taking place? Read on to find out more. Key takeaways What is ovulation? Before we dive into ovulation signs and symptoms, let’s refresh our minds on what ovulation involves. Ovulation is a regular part of yourmenstrual cycle. During ovulation, one of your ovaries (either the left or the right) willrelease an egg. After this, the egg willtravel through a uterine tube(also known as a fallopian tube), where it may or may not befertilized by a sperm. This is where it getsreallyinteresting because what happens after ovulation depends on whether a sperm fertilizes the egg or not. If a sperm does fertilize the egg, thisfertilized eggwill move into the uterus, where it can burrow in and implant itself into the uterine lining. As you can probably guess, thisresults in a pregnancy, and you won’t ovulate again until after your pregnancy has ended. If a sperm doesn’t fertilize the egg, however, it will eventually disintegrate, and your body willshed your uterine liningthrough the vagina. This is the bleeding you know as a period. So whether you’re trying to conceive or want to understand your body better, knowing when you ovulate and how to track it, as well as some of the possible ovulation symptoms and signs, can be powerful knowledge indeed. When do you ovulate? It would be great if you couldtrack your ovulation dayslike regular days of the week. However, you only need to ask a handful of your friends about their periods to know thateveryone’s cycle is different, which means it’s rarely as straightforward as that. And, to complicate matters even further,your own cycle will varythroughout your life. But while you can’t always say for certain when you’ll ovulate each month, there are ways to make a pretty accurate prediction (phew!).Generally speaking, you’ll ovulate around14 daysbefore your period arrives. That means that in a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation will happen somewhere around the 14th day. We count the first day of your period as the first day of your cycle.But as we know, themajority of people don’t have a 28-day cycle; in fact, a normal cycle can range from21 to 35 days. So ovulation could happen either earlier or later than the 14th day, depending on the length of your cycle. You can use Flo’s handyovulation calculatorto predict when ovulation might occur based on your own cycle dates; clever, huh? How long does it last? Not long at all: themoment of ovulation itself is instant. Following this, the egg cansurvive for up to 24 hours. However, keep in mind that your fertile window (aka the time in your menstrual cycle when you’re most likely to get pregnant) is much longer than this. Peak fertility will be theday you ovulate, as well as the five days leading up to ovulation itself.Hang on. You’re fertile the five days leading up to ovulation, too? How does this happen? Well, sperm can survive in your body forup to five days after sex(yes, really), meaning you could have had sex several days before ovulation, and some sperm could have waited inside your reproductive system until the moment your egg is released. At that point, it’s perfectly possible for the sperm to fertilize your newly released egg and for a pregnancy to occur.So if you’retrying to conceive, it’s mighty useful to be aware of when your fertile window is likely to be, so you can plan accordingly. Ovulation signs and symptoms So, how do you know when you’re ovulating? Your body might give you some guidance on figuring this one out, as you’re likely to experience a number of different telltale signs and symptomswhen ovulation is happening. Keep in mind that no two people are the same, and each person will feel these symptoms at a different degree of intensity, if at all. Let’s take a closer look below.

Understand your body better by tracking your cycle with Flo Key takeaways Can you have sex on your period? If you and your partner are up forhaving period sex, there’s no reason not to have it. It may still feel a little bit taboo, but it’s thought that between3% and 30%of sexually active women choose to have period sex. But since there will be blood involved, is it safe? “Yes, it is safe to have sex during your menstrual cycle,” saysDr. Renita White, obstetrician and gynecologist, Georgia Obstetrics and Gynecology, US. “Though blood is present from the period, there is no risk of hurting yourself or your sexual partner.” If you find yourself with a higher libido during your period, then this is great news. However, while sex on your period is perfectly safe, it’s still important to remember thatyou can still get pregnantorcontract an STIat this point in your cycle, so youstill need to use contraception. If you aren’t sure what the best type of birth control is for you,you can learn more here. So, let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons of period sex more closely. Benefits of period sex Extra lubrication One bonus is that period blood may help reduce friction during penetrative sex. “The menstrual blood can serve as natural lubrication during intercourse,” says Dr. White. This can make penetrative sex more enjoyable. Pain relief Dr. White explains that yourbody releases feel-good chemicalsduring sex called endorphins — one of thehealth benefits of sex. “The endorphins released during sex and orgasm may help improve menstrual cramp discomfort,” she says. Heightened enjoyment Sex and your periodcan be a winning combination, because you may find sex is extra pleasurable this time of the month. “Some people have a higher libido during menstruation, so they may enjoy having more sex, but it all depends on the person,” says Dr. White. “Plus, during menstruation, there is more blood flow to the uterus, pelvic floor, and vagina. This can increase sensitivity during sex. For some, it can make sex more enjoyable. But for others, it may cause more discomfort.” So check in with how you’re feeling and never feel pressured into doing anything you don’t want to do. Take a quiz Find out what you can do with our Health Assistant Possible consequences of period sex Mess When it comes to period sex, a little bit of mess comes with the territory. And this isn’t something you or your partner should be scared of or grossed out by. Period blood is totally natural and safe. You may just want to take some extra steps when preparing and cleaning up afterward. “Sex during the menstrual cycle may be more messy than usual due to the blood that is present,” says Dr. White. Whether you decide to protect your bedding with a towel or use an old or dark-colored set of sheets, there are lots of ways you can minimize cleanup time afterward. One thing you might want to consider is using amenstrual disc. This is a shallow disc made of plastic or silicone that you insert below your cervix in the vagina to collect period blood. Not only can it protect you from leaks forup to 12 hours, but you can keep it in during period sex. Unlike other menstrual products, menstrual discssit higher in the vaginal canaland are less likely to interfere with sex. STIs You can stillcatch STIsfrom period sex. “It’s possible totransmit STIsany time during unprotected sex, whether on your period or not,” says Dr. White. “However, some viruses (like hepatitis) can live in blood. So there is a higher risk of transmission during your period.” A couple of ways to ensure that both you and your partner are looking after your sexual health areattending STI screeningsif you’ve had sex with someone new and always wearingbarrier protection like a condom or internal condom. If you’re having oral sex, using adental damcan help to protect you against STIs. Pregnancy It’s also possible toget pregnantif you have sex during your period. While it’s less likely to happen now rather than atother points in your cycle, it’s still really important to use birth control if you don’t want to get pregnant. Did you know that your sex drive depends on the cycle phase you’re in? Tips for enjoyable period sex Whether you’d rather do it in the shower, on a towel, or focus solely on oral sex, period sex can look different for everyone. However, sex should always be enjoyable, and both you and your partner should be on the same page with what you’re comfortable with. If you aren’t sure how to approach period sex, there are a few things you can consider. Communicate with your partner So much enjoyment in sex comes from communicating with your partner beforehand. Knowing what your partner likes and feels comfortable with can make sex so much better. Period sex is no exception to this. If you know you’d like to have sex at this time in your cycle, then chat with your partner about it to make sure you’re both on the same page. You’ll feel more relaxed knowing that you’re both excited to try it. Keep using contraception Period sex can feel new and exciting, but it’s still important to take action againstcatching an STIorbecoming pregnantif you don’t want to have a baby right now. Condoms are the only kind of birth control that canprotect you against STIs, and you might already be using a different type of contraception to avoid pregnancy. “Though you’re less likely to get pregnant on your period if you have a predictable menstrual cycle,it is not impossible,” says Dr. White. “Sperm can live in the body for up to five days. So if you have unprotected sex during your period and ovulate shortly afterward, you would be able to get pregnant. Prepare yourself for a little mess The word mess has a lot of negative connotations, and there’s still some stigma attached to period sex because there may be blood involved. The truth is your period is nothing to be ashamed of, and period blood is safe. However, for the sake of your favorite sheets, you might want to prepare for sex during this time in your cycle. You might choose to have sex in the shower, so any blood washes away. You could also put a large, dark-colored towel on your sheets to catch any blood. You could also use an old set of sheets to save wear and tear on your favorite linens. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment, so try to remember to take any menstrual products out before having sex (unless you’re using a menstrual disc). While you’ll need to remove a tampon or menstrual cup before penetrative sex, some people choose to keep them in during foreplay. Remove your tampon or menstrual cup As things start to get heated, you might feel most comfortable keepingyour period productin until just before you have penetrative sex. If you decide that you’d like to stick to oral sex during your period, then you can leave your tampon or menstrual cup in.
