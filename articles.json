Sensitive nipples after ovulation: What does it mean? Key takeaways Is it normal for nipples to be sensitive after ovulation? Before we dig into whether it\u2019s normal for your nipples to be sensitive after ovulation, it\u2019s helpful to understandwhat ovulation actually is. Put simply, ovulation is the point in your menstrual cycle when one of your ovariesreleases an egg. After it leaves your ovary, the egg moves down one of your uterine (or fallopian) tubes. It can remain there for 12 to 24 hours. If you have unprotected sex around this time, then a sperm may fertilize the egg, and you might become pregnant. If this doesn\u2019t happen, then it will disintegrate. While it can differ from person to person and throughout your lifetime, ovulation will usually happen around14 days before your next period. This means that if you have anaverage cycle of 28 days, you will ovulate midway through,around day 14. In reality, we all have slightly different cycle lengths \u2014 meaning the exact day of ovulation varies. Just know that if your cycle isbetween 21 and 35 dayslong, then it\u2019s considered typical. You canunderstand your cycle betterand estimate when you might ovulate using an app like Flo.

Getting to know your menstrual cycle As you get to know your menstrual cycle a little better, it\u2019s good to remember that: What is the luteal phase? Know your cycle and symptoms Track your cycle in the Flo app Key takeaways What is the luteal phase? Knowing where you are in your cycle can help youbetter understand your bodyand symptoms. So, here\u2019s a quick refresher onthe two parts of your cycle: thefollicular phaseand the luteal phase. Thefollicular phaseis the first part of your cycle. It starts on the first day of a new period. During this phase,your body prepares an egg to be releasedduring ovulation. The day after ovulation marks the first day of your luteal phase. Your luteal phase can look a little bit different depending on whether you conceived during your fertile window or not. If you did, then yourfertilized egg may travel downyour uterine or fallopian tube and implant into the lining of your uterus. If you didn\u2019t get pregnant during this part of your cycle, then youregg can remain viable for up to 24 hoursand will then disintegrate. Know when your period is likely to arrive Take a quiz What are common symptoms during the luteal phase? As your cycle is pretty personal to you, so are some of the signs and symptoms you might experience during your luteal phase. You might not feel any different at all. However, some people report: What actually happens in the luteal phase? As ovulation marks the start of your luteal phase, and you end it by potentially preparing for a new period, a lot happens in the second part of your cycle. So, here\u2019s what\u2019s happening during your luteal phase. How long does the luteal phase last? It can betough to predict exactly how long your luteal phase will lastbecause everybody\u2019s cycle is slightly different. For many people, theirluteal phase lasts between 12 and 14 days. However, if your luteal phase is between 10 and 16 days, it\u2019d be considered normal. You cantrack your cycle using an app like Floto get familiar with what\u2019s typical for you. If the luteal phase lasts less than 10 days, it would beconsidered short. If it lasts 16 days or longer, then it\u2019d be considered long. This isn\u2019t typically something to worry about, but it may be a good idea to mention it to your health care provider. People who experience a long luteal phase may have a hormonal imbalance, such aspolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can cause irregular periods. If you don\u2019t get your period as expected, you could also be pregnant. If you have any concerns, speak to your doctor. What causes a short luteal phase, and how does it affect fertility? A short luteal phase is when your luteal phaselasts less than 10 days. It\u2019s relatively rare for this to happen. Research has shown that up toaround 5% of people experience short luteal phasesduring their reproductive years. For some people, a short luteal phase has no noticeable impact, and research has shown that if you notice that your luteal phase is short one cycle but not in others, then itwon\u2019t significantly affect fertility in the long term. However, if you\u2019re concerned that your cycle length is impacting your chance of becoming pregnant, then it\u2019s always a good idea to talk with your doctor.

Whether you\u2019re trying to conceive or simply want to understand your own body better, learning about ovulation is a great place to start. But what exactly is ovulation, and what telltale signs and symptoms might your body give you that it\u2019s taking place? Read on to find out more. Figure out when you're likely to be ovulating in the Flo app Key takeaways What is ovulation? Before we dive into ovulation signs and symptoms, let\u2019s refresh our minds on what ovulation involves. Ovulation is a regular part of yourmenstrual cycle. During ovulation, one of your ovaries (either the left or the right) willrelease an egg. After this, the egg willtravel through a uterine tube(also known as a fallopian tube), where it may or may not befertilized by a sperm. This is where it getsreallyinteresting because what happens after ovulation depends on whether a sperm fertilizes the egg or not. If a sperm does fertilize the egg, thisfertilized eggwill move into the uterus, where it can burrow in and implant itself into the uterine lining. As you can probably guess, thisresults in a pregnancy, and you won\u2019t ovulate again until after your pregnancy has ended. If a sperm doesn\u2019t fertilize the egg, however, it will eventually disintegrate, and your body willshed your uterine liningthrough the vagina. This is the bleeding you know as a period. So whether you\u2019re trying to conceive or want to understand your body better, knowing when you ovulate and how to track it, as well as some of the possible ovulation symptoms and signs, can be powerful knowledge indeed. Your cycle is so much more than your period When do you ovulate? It would be great if you couldtrack your ovulation dayslike regular days of the week. However, you only need to ask a handful of your friends about their periods to know thateveryone\u2019s cycle is different, which means it\u2019s rarely as straightforward as that. And, to complicate matters even further,your own cycle will varythroughout your life. But while you can\u2019t always say for certain when you\u2019ll ovulate each month, there are ways to make a pretty accurate prediction (phew!).Generally speaking, you\u2019ll ovulate around14 daysbefore your period arrives. That means that in a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation will happen somewhere around the 14th day. We count the first day of your period as the first day of your cycle.But as we know, themajority of people don\u2019t have a 28-day cycle; in fact, a normal cycle can range from21 to 35 days. So ovulation could happen either earlier or later than the 14th day, depending on the length of your cycle. You can use Flo\u2019s handyovulation calculatorto predict when ovulation might occur based on your own cycle dates; clever, huh? How long does it last? Not long at all: themoment of ovulation itself is instant. Following this, the egg cansurvive for up to 24 hours. However, keep in mind that your fertile window (aka the time in your menstrual cycle when you\u2019re most likely to get pregnant) is much longer than this. Peak fertility will be theday you ovulate, as well as the five days leading up to ovulation itself.Hang on. You\u2019re fertile the five days leading up to ovulation, too? How does this happen? Well, sperm can survive in your body forup to five days after sex(yes, really), meaning you could have had sex several days before ovulation, and some sperm could have waited inside your reproductive system until the moment your egg is released. At that point, it\u2019s perfectly possible for the sperm to fertilize your newly released egg and for a pregnancy to occur.So if you\u2019retrying to conceive, it\u2019s mighty useful to be aware of when your fertile window is likely to be, so you can plan accordingly. Take a quiz Find out what you can do with our Health Assistant Ovulation signs and symptoms So, how do you know when you\u2019re ovulating? Your body might give you some guidance on figuring this one out, as you\u2019re likely to experience a number of different telltale signs and symptomswhen ovulation is happening. Keep in mind that no two people are the same, and each person will feel these symptoms at a different degree of intensity, if at all. Let\u2019s take a closer look below. Cervical mucus changes For starters, one of the classic signs that ovulation is happening soon is achange in your vaginal discharge(aka cervical mucus).This dischargewill be different from what you might usually see in your underwear; it will be clear and have a thinner, more slippery consistency, just likeraw egg whites. Body temperature changes After ovulation, you might also experience a smallrise in yourbasal body temperature(that\u2019s the temperature of your body when you\u2019re resting) of aroundhalf a degree Fahrenheit(0.3 Celsius). Intrigued and want to know how to measure it accurately? We\u2019ll take a closer look at this later in the article. Changes in the cervix There are also somechanges that happen to your cervixduring ovulation. If you want to get to know your body better, then you can use your finger tocheck your cervix; make sure you wash your hands, and then gently insert one of your fingers into your vagina untilyou feel your cervix. You\u2019ll notice that just during ovulation, it will behigher and feel soft. You\u2019ll also notice that after ovulation is over, it becomes much harder again. Examining your own cervix can be tricky, of course, so if you don\u2019t notice much of a difference, don\u2019t worry. Most people find it easier to observe changes in cervical mucus than changes in the texture and position of the cervix. Breast soreness or tenderness The rush of hormones before and during ovulation can lead tobreast soreness and tenderness.This can rangefrommild breast painthat\u2019s barely noticeable to severe pain that makes it uncomfortable to wear tight clothing. Don\u2019t suffer in silence if this is affecting your day-to-day life; be sure to reach out to your doctor to discuss any possible treatment options. Pelvic or abdominal pain It\u2019s not a myth: you might feel aslight painin the lower part of your abdomen as ovulation occurs. Remember that you\u2019ll only feel this pain on one side, depending on which ovary has released an egg that month.You\u2019ll probably experience this ache, known asmittelschmerz(a German word that means \u201cmiddle pain\u201d or \u201cpain in the middle of the month\u201d), fora couple of minutes or even days. While this might be alarming, rest assured that thepain is normaland should subside. If it doesn\u2019t stop, and painkillers don\u2019t help, be sure to reach out to your doctor to make sure everything is OK. Bloating Do you getbloated when you ovulate? You\u2019re not alone. This is another typicalsymptom of ovulation, and it occurs due to the hormonal changes that are happening around this time. If it\u2019s making you feel (understandably) uncomfortable, thenstaying hydrated and opting for smaller mealscould help. Light spotting During ovulation, you might also experience somelight bleeding or spotting. Again, this is no cause for concern, but if it lasts longer than a day or two or is particularly heavy, be sure to reach out to your doctor. Libido changes Just before ovulation, there is arise in the levels of a hormone called estrogen, and this can mean that you may start to feel moreturned onthan usual. Your libido might thendrop again after ovulationas the levels of estrogen decrease. This is totally normal, but it\u2019s a symptom that not everyone experiences, so if it doesn\u2019t happen to you, don\u2019t be concerned. Nausea As if bloating, cramping, and breast soreness weren\u2019t enough, the change in hormones during your menstrual cycle that causes pain can also causesome people to feel nauseous. If you\u2019re affected by this, tryheading outside for some fresh airordrinking peppermint or ginger tea. How to detect ovulation Ready to figure out when you\u2019re next going to ovulate? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the methods available. Chart your menstrual cycle The other way you can predict ovulation is bytracking your periodsover several months using an app likeFlo. By recording the days when your period begins and ends, you can figure out your average cycle length. You can then use this information to determine when in your cycle you\u2019re likely to ovulate, which, as we know, is around14 days before your period begins. Monitor your basal body temperature (BBT) Remember we said you might experience aslight rise in your basal body temperatureafter ovulation? Even though the rise is small, you may be able tonotice the change on a digital thermometerif you consistently track your temperature around the same time each day of your menstrual cycle, preferably first thing in the morning. However, it\u2019s important to note that this isnot a recommended methodof birth control or an accurate way to predict ovulation if you\u2019re trying to get pregnant, as your temperature can be affected by a number of factors, and you only see the rise in temperature after ovulation has already occurred. Ovulation kit You could also try anovulation kit, which you might also know as an ovulation test or ovulation stick. These work bymeasuring your body\u2019s level of luteinizing hormonethrough your pee. You\u2019ll get asurge of this hormonejust before you ovulate, so it\u2019s a good indicator of when ovulation will occur, which is valuable information indeed if you\u2019re trying for a baby. You usually use these kits by holding the test or stick in your pee for a set amount of time (depending on the product) and then waiting for the results to show \u2014 similar to a pregnancy test. For the most accurate results, you should try to take the test at aroundthe same time every day. Ovulation calculator Looking for an even simpler way to understand when ovulation might occur? We hear you. Why not try ourovulation calculatorthat we mentioned earlier, too? All you need to do is enter the first day of your last period and your average cycle length, and the calculator will crunch the numbers for you. Saliva test The saliva test is a little-known test that can sometimes (but not always) show when you\u2019re ovulating. It works by looking atpatterns in your saliva, which might make a fern-shaped pattern during ovulation. However, this test isn\u2019t widely used becausenot every woman\u2019s salivamakes this shape, so the tests aren\u2019t particularly accurate. So if you\u2019re looking for a more accurate way of detecting ovulation, one of the other methods is likely to be more reliable. Ovulation disorders It can also be helpful to know about some of the problems with ovulation that can sometimes happen. These canimpact how regularly you ovulateand sometimes even prevent ovulation from happening: Note:Ovulation predictions should never be used for birth control. FAQs Can you feel it when you ovulate? As we\u2019ve seen, you might feel a bit of pain,known asmittelschmerz, for a couple of minutes (or even days!) when you ovulate. This will usually be on one side of your belly, depending on which ovary released an egg. Can a man sense when a woman is ovulating? Strange but true: A man might indeed be able to sense when a woman is ovulating, although not necessarily on a conscious level.One studyfound that the scent of ovulating women could increase testosterone levels and reduce cortisol levels in men, suggesting that their bodies subconsciously respond to ovulation. Does ovulation pain mean you\u2019re more fertile? Ovulation is a key part of the journey to getting pregnant, as a woman\u2019s body needs torelease an eggin order for sperm to fertilize it. Therefore, ovulation itself can be an indicator of fertility, but there is no evidence to suggest that ovulation pain is a sign of increased fertility. Does ovulation make you tired and hungry? There is no evidence to suggest that ovulation can make you feel tired and hungry. However, the combination of all the ovulation symptoms we\u2019ve explored in this article could potentially take a toll on your energy levels. Do you gain weight during ovulation? Bloating is typicalaround the time of ovulation, and the water retention may make you feel like you\u2019ve gained a little weight. Ifbloating during ovulationis uncomfortable, you can trystaying hydrated and eating smaller mealsto help relieve it.

References History of updates Related articles Flo App Company Content Legal Whether you\u2019re trying to conceive or simply want to understand your own body better, learning about ovulation is a great place to start. But what exactly is ovulation, and what telltale signs and symptoms might your body give you that it\u2019s taking place? Read on to find out more. Key takeaways What is ovulation? Before we dive into ovulation signs and symptoms, let\u2019s refresh our minds on what ovulation involves. Ovulation is a regular part of yourmenstrual cycle. During ovulation, one of your ovaries (either the left or the right) willrelease an egg. After this, the egg willtravel through a uterine tube(also known as a fallopian tube), where it may or may not befertilized by a sperm. This is where it getsreallyinteresting because what happens after ovulation depends on whether a sperm fertilizes the egg or not. If a sperm does fertilize the egg, thisfertilized eggwill move into the uterus, where it can burrow in and implant itself into the uterine lining. As you can probably guess, thisresults in a pregnancy, and you won\u2019t ovulate again until after your pregnancy has ended. If a sperm doesn\u2019t fertilize the egg, however, it will eventually disintegrate, and your body willshed your uterine liningthrough the vagina. This is the bleeding you know as a period. So whether you\u2019re trying to conceive or want to understand your body better, knowing when you ovulate and how to track it, as well as some of the possible ovulation symptoms and signs, can be powerful knowledge indeed. When do you ovulate? It would be great if you couldtrack your ovulation dayslike regular days of the week. However, you only need to ask a handful of your friends about their periods to know thateveryone\u2019s cycle is different, which means it\u2019s rarely as straightforward as that. And, to complicate matters even further,your own cycle will varythroughout your life. But while you can\u2019t always say for certain when you\u2019ll ovulate each month, there are ways to make a pretty accurate prediction (phew!).Generally speaking, you\u2019ll ovulate around14 daysbefore your period arrives. That means that in a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation will happen somewhere around the 14th day. We count the first day of your period as the first day of your cycle.But as we know, themajority of people don\u2019t have a 28-day cycle; in fact, a normal cycle can range from21 to 35 days. So ovulation could happen either earlier or later than the 14th day, depending on the length of your cycle. You can use Flo\u2019s handyovulation calculatorto predict when ovulation might occur based on your own cycle dates; clever, huh? How long does it last? Not long at all: themoment of ovulation itself is instant. Following this, the egg cansurvive for up to 24 hours. However, keep in mind that your fertile window (aka the time in your menstrual cycle when you\u2019re most likely to get pregnant) is much longer than this. Peak fertility will be theday you ovulate, as well as the five days leading up to ovulation itself.Hang on. You\u2019re fertile the five days leading up to ovulation, too? How does this happen? Well, sperm can survive in your body forup to five days after sex(yes, really), meaning you could have had sex several days before ovulation, and some sperm could have waited inside your reproductive system until the moment your egg is released. At that point, it\u2019s perfectly possible for the sperm to fertilize your newly released egg and for a pregnancy to occur.So if you\u2019retrying to conceive, it\u2019s mighty useful to be aware of when your fertile window is likely to be, so you can plan accordingly. Ovulation signs and symptoms So, how do you know when you\u2019re ovulating? Your body might give you some guidance on figuring this one out, as you\u2019re likely to experience a number of different telltale signs and symptomswhen ovulation is happening. Keep in mind that no two people are the same, and each person will feel these symptoms at a different degree of intensity, if at all. Let\u2019s take a closer look below. Cervical mucus changes For starters, one of the classic signs that ovulation is happening soon is achange in your vaginal discharge(aka cervical mucus).This dischargewill be different from what you might usually see in your underwear; it will be clear and have a thinner, more slippery consistency, just likeraw egg whites. Body temperature changes After ovulation, you might also experience a smallrise in yourbasal body temperature(that\u2019s the temperature of your body when you\u2019re resting) of aroundhalf a degree Fahrenheit(0.3 Celsius).

You\u2019ll notice that just during ovulation, it will behigher and feel soft. You\u2019ll also notice that after ovulation is over, it becomes much harder again. Examining your own cervix can be tricky, of course, so if you don\u2019t notice much of a difference, don\u2019t worry. Most people find it easier to observe changes in cervical mucus than changes in the texture and position of the cervix. Breast soreness or tenderness The rush of hormones before and during ovulation can lead tobreast soreness and tenderness.This can rangefrommild breast painthat\u2019s barely noticeable to severe pain that makes it uncomfortable to wear tight clothing. Don\u2019t suffer in silence if this is affecting your day-to-day life; be sure to reach out to your doctor to discuss any possible treatment options. Pelvic or abdominal pain It\u2019s not a myth: you might feel aslight painin the lower part of your abdomen as ovulation occurs. Remember that you\u2019ll only feel this pain on one side, depending on which ovary has released an egg that month.You\u2019ll probably experience this ache, known asmittelschmerz(a German word that means \u201cmiddle pain\u201d or \u201cpain in the middle of the month\u201d), fora couple of minutes or even days. While this might be alarming, rest assured that thepain is normaland should subside.

You can then use this information to determine when in your cycle you\u2019re likely to ovulate, which, as we know, is around14 days before your period begins. Monitor your basal body temperature (BBT) Remember we said you might experience aslight rise in your basal body temperatureafter ovulation? Even though the rise is small, you may be able tonotice the change on a digital thermometerif you consistently track your temperature around the same time each day of your menstrual cycle, preferably first thing in the morning. However, it\u2019s important to note that this isnot a recommended methodof birth control or an accurate way to predict ovulation if you\u2019re trying to get pregnant, as your temperature can be affected by a number of factors, and you only see the rise in temperature after ovulation has already occurred. Ovulation kit You could also try anovulation kit, which you might also know as an ovulation test or ovulation stick. These work bymeasuring your body\u2019s level of luteinizing hormonethrough your pee.

We hear you. Why not try ourovulation calculatorthat we mentioned earlier, too? All you need to do is enter the first day of your last period and your average cycle length, and the calculator will crunch the numbers for you. Saliva test The saliva test is a little-known test that can sometimes (but not always) show when you\u2019re ovulating. It works by looking atpatterns in your saliva, which might make a fern-shaped pattern during ovulation. However, this test isn\u2019t widely used becausenot every woman\u2019s salivamakes this shape, so the tests aren\u2019t particularly accurate. So if you\u2019re looking for a more accurate way of detecting ovulation, one of the other methods is likely to be more reliable. Ovulation disorders It can also be helpful to know about some of the problems with ovulation that can sometimes happen. These canimpact how regularly you ovulateand sometimes even prevent ovulation from happening: Note:Ovulation predictions should never be used for birth control. What does ovulation feel like? 9 ovulation signs and symptoms Figure out when you're likely to be ovulating in the Flo app Key takeaways What is ovulation? Before we dive into ovulation signs and symptoms, let\u2019s refresh our minds on what ovulation involves. Ovulation is a regular part of yourmenstrual cycle. During ovulation, one of your ovaries (either the left or the right) willrelease an egg. After this, the egg willtravel through a uterine tube(also known as a fallopian tube), where it may or may not befertilized by a sperm. This is where it getsreallyinteresting because what happens after ovulation depends on whether a sperm fertilizes the egg or not. If a sperm does fertilize the egg, thisfertilized eggwill move into the uterus, where it can burrow in and implant itself into the uterine lining. As you can probably guess, thisresults in a pregnancy, and you won\u2019t ovulate again until after your pregnancy has ended. If a sperm doesn\u2019t fertilize the egg, however, it will eventually disintegrate, and your body willshed your uterine liningthrough the vagina. This is the bleeding you know as a period. So whether you\u2019re trying to conceive or want to understand your body better, knowing when you ovulate and how to track it, as well as some of the possible ovulation symptoms and signs, can be powerful knowledge indeed. Your cycle is so much more than your period When do you ovulate? It would be great if you couldtrack your ovulation dayslike regular days of the week. However, you only need to ask a handful of your friends about their periods to know thateveryone\u2019s cycle is different, which means it\u2019s rarely as straightforward as that. And, to complicate matters even further,your own cycle will varythroughout your life. But while you can\u2019t always say for certain when you\u2019ll ovulate each month, there are ways to make a pretty accurate prediction (phew!).Generally speaking, you\u2019ll ovulate around14 daysbefore your period arrives. That means that in a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation will happen somewhere around the 14th day. We count the first day of your period as the first day of your cycle.But as we know, themajority of people don\u2019t have a 28-day cycle; in fact, a normal cycle can range from21 to 35 days. So ovulation could happen either earlier or later than the 14th day, depending on the length of your cycle. You can use Flo\u2019s handyovulation calculatorto predict when ovulation might occur based on your own cycle dates; clever, huh? How long does it last? Not long at all: themoment of ovulation itself is instant. Following this, the egg cansurvive for up to 24 hours. However, keep in mind that your fertile window (aka the time in your menstrual cycle when you\u2019re most likely to get pregnant) is much longer than this. Peak fertility will be theday you ovulate, as well as the five days leading up to ovulation itself.Hang on. You\u2019re fertile the five days leading up to ovulation, too? How does this happen? Well, sperm can survive in your body forup to five days after sex(yes, really), meaning you could have had sex several days before ovulation, and some sperm could have waited inside your reproductive system until the moment your egg is released. At that point, it\u2019s perfectly possible for the sperm to fertilize your newly released egg and for a pregnancy to occur.So if you\u2019retrying to conceive, it\u2019s mighty useful to be aware of when your fertile window is likely to be, so you can plan accordingly. Take a quiz Ovulation signs and symptoms So, how do you know when you\u2019re ovulating? Your body might give you some guidance on figuring this one out, as you\u2019re likely to experience a number of different telltale signs and symptomswhen ovulation is happening. Keep in mind that no two people are the same, and each person will feel these symptoms at a different degree of intensity, if at all. Let\u2019s take a closer look below. Cervical mucus changes For starters, one of the classic signs that ovulation is happening soon is achange in your vaginal discharge(aka cervical mucus).This dischargewill be different from what you might usually see in your underwear; it will be clear and have a thinner, more slippery consistency, just likeraw egg whites. Body temperature changes After ovulation, you might also experience a smallrise in yourbasal body temperature(that\u2019s the temperature of your body when you\u2019re resting) of aroundhalf a degree Fahrenheit(0.3 Celsius). Intrigued and want to know how to measure it accurately? We\u2019ll take a closer look at this later in the article. Changes in the cervix There are also somechanges that happen to your cervixduring ovulation. If you want to get to know your body better, then you can use your finger tocheck your cervix; make sure you wash your hands, and then gently insert one of your fingers into your vagina untilyou feel your cervix. You\u2019ll notice that just during ovulation, it will behigher and feel soft. You\u2019ll also notice that after ovulation is over, it becomes much harder again. Examining your own cervix can be tricky, of course, so if you don\u2019t notice much of a difference, don\u2019t worry. Most people find it easier to observe changes in cervical mucus than changes in the texture and position of the cervix. Breast soreness or tenderness The rush of hormones before and during ovulation can lead tobreast soreness and tenderness.This can rangefrommild breast painthat\u2019s barely noticeable to severe pain that makes it uncomfortable to wear tight clothing. Don\u2019t suffer in silence if this is affecting your day-to-day life; be sure to reach out to your doctor to discuss any possible treatment options. Pelvic or abdominal pain It\u2019s not a myth: you might feel aslight painin the lower part of your abdomen as ovulation occurs. Remember that you\u2019ll only feel this pain on one side, depending on which ovary has released an egg that month.You\u2019ll probably experience this ache, known asmittelschmerz(a German word that means \u201cmiddle pain\u201d or \u201cpain in the middle of the month\u201d), fora couple of minutes or even days. While this might be alarming, rest assured that thepain is normaland should subside. If it doesn\u2019t stop, and painkillers don\u2019t help, be sure to reach out to your doctor to make sure everything is OK. Bloating Do you getbloated when you ovulate? You\u2019re not alone. This is another typicalsymptom of ovulation, and it occurs due to the hormonal changes that are happening around this time. If it\u2019s making you feel (understandably) uncomfortable, thenstaying hydrated and opting for smaller mealscould help. Light spotting During ovulation, you might also experience somelight bleeding or spotting. Again, this is no cause for concern, but if it lasts longer than a day or two or is particularly heavy, be sure to reach out to your doctor. Libido changes Just before ovulation, there is arise in the levels of a hormone called estrogen, and this can mean that you may start to feel moreturned onthan usual. Your libido might thendrop again after ovulationas the levels of estrogen decrease. This is totally normal, but it\u2019s a symptom that not everyone experiences, so if it doesn\u2019t happen to you, don\u2019t be concerned. Nausea As if bloating, cramping, and breast soreness weren\u2019t enough, the change in hormones during your menstrual cycle that causes pain can also causesome people to feel nauseous. If you\u2019re affected by this, tryheading outside for some fresh airordrinking peppermint or ginger tea. How to detect ovulation Ready to figure out when you\u2019re next going to ovulate? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the methods available. Chart your menstrual cycle The other way you can predict ovulation is bytracking your periodsover several months using an app likeFlo. By recording the days when your period begins and ends, you can figure out your average cycle length. You can then use this information to determine when in your cycle you\u2019re likely to ovulate, which, as we know, is around14 days before your period begins. Monitor your basal body temperature (BBT) Remember we said you might experience aslight rise in your basal body temperatureafter ovulation? Even though the rise is small, you may be able tonotice the change on a digital thermometerif you consistently track your temperature around the same time each day of your menstrual cycle, preferably first thing in the morning. However, it\u2019s important to note that this isnot a recommended methodof birth control or an accurate way to predict ovulation if you\u2019re trying to get pregnant, as your temperature can be affected by a number of factors, and you only see the rise in temperature after ovulation has already occurred. Ovulation kit You could also try anovulation kit, which you might also know as an ovulation test or ovulation stick. These work bymeasuring your body\u2019s level of luteinizing hormonethrough your pee. You\u2019ll get asurge of this hormonejust before you ovulate, so it\u2019s a good indicator of when ovulation will occur, which is valuable information indeed if you\u2019re trying for a baby. You usually use these kits by holding the test or stick in your pee for a set amount of time (depending on the product) and then waiting for the results to show \u2014 similar to a pregnancy test. For the most accurate results, you should try to take the test at aroundthe same time every day. Ovulation calculator Looking for an even simpler way to understand when ovulation might occur?

This can increase sensitivity during sex. For some, it can make sex more enjoyable. But for others, it may cause more discomfort.\u201d So check in with how you\u2019re feeling and never feel pressured into doing anything you don\u2019t want to do. Take a quiz Find out what you can do with our Health Assistant Possible consequences of period sex Mess When it comes to period sex, a little bit of mess comes with the territory. And this isn\u2019t something you or your partner should be scared of or grossed out by. Period blood is totally natural and safe. You may just want to take some extra steps when preparing and cleaning up afterward. \u201cSex during the menstrual cycle may be more messy than usual due to the blood that is present,\u201d says Dr. White. Whether you decide to protect your bedding with a towel or use an old or dark-colored set of sheets, there are lots of ways you can minimize cleanup time afterward. One thing you might want to consider is using amenstrual disc. This is a shallow disc made of plastic or silicone that you insert below your cervix in the vagina to collect period blood. Not only can it protect you from leaks forup to 12 hours, but you can keep it in during period sex. Unlike other menstrual products, menstrual discssit higher in the vaginal canaland are less likely to interfere with sex. STIs You can stillcatch STIsfrom period sex. \u201cIt\u2019s possible totransmit STIsany time during unprotected sex, whether on your period or not,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cHowever, some viruses (like hepatitis) can live in blood. So there is a higher risk of transmission during your period.\u201d A couple of ways to ensure that both you and your partner are looking after your sexual health areattending STI screeningsif you\u2019ve had sex with someone new and always wearingbarrier protection like a condom or internal condom. If you\u2019re having oral sex, using adental damcan help to protect you against STIs. Pregnancy It\u2019s also possible toget pregnantif you have sex during your period. While it\u2019s less likely to happen now rather than atother points in your cycle, it\u2019s still really important to use birth control if you don\u2019t want to get pregnant. Did you know that your sex drive depends on the cycle phase you\u2019re in? Tips for enjoyable period sex Whether you\u2019d rather do it in the shower, on a towel, or focus solely on oral sex, period sex can look different for everyone. However, sex should always be enjoyable, and both you and your partner should be on the same page with what you\u2019re comfortable with. If you aren\u2019t sure how to approach period sex, there are a few things you can consider. Communicate with your partner So much enjoyment in sex comes from communicating with your partner beforehand. Knowing what your partner likes and feels comfortable with can make sex so much better. Period sex is no exception to this. If you know you\u2019d like to have sex at this time in your cycle, then chat with your partner about it to make sure you\u2019re both on the same page. You\u2019ll feel more relaxed knowing that you\u2019re both excited to try it. Keep using contraception Period sex can feel new and exciting, but it\u2019s still important to take action againstcatching an STIorbecoming pregnantif you don\u2019t want to have a baby right now. Condoms are the only kind of birth control that canprotect you against STIs, and you might already be using a different type of contraception to avoid pregnancy. \u201cThough you\u2019re less likely to get pregnant on your period if you have a predictable menstrual cycle,it is not impossible,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cSperm can live in the body for up to five days. So if you have unprotected sex during your period and ovulate shortly afterward, you would be able to get pregnant. Prepare yourself for a little mess The word mess has a lot of negative connotations, and there\u2019s still some stigma attached to period sex because there may be blood involved. The truth is your period is nothing to be ashamed of, and period blood is safe. However, for the sake of your favorite sheets, you might want to prepare for sex during this time in your cycle. You might choose to have sex in the shower, so any blood washes away. You could also put a large, dark-colored towel on your sheets to catch any blood. You could also use an old set of sheets to save wear and tear on your favorite linens. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the moment, so try to remember to take any menstrual products out before having sex (unless you\u2019re using a menstrual disc). While you\u2019ll need to remove a tampon or menstrual cup before penetrative sex, some people choose to keep them in during foreplay. Remove your tampon or menstrual cup As things start to get heated, you might feel most comfortable keepingyour period productin until just before you have penetrative sex. If you decide that you\u2019d like to stick to oral sex during your period, then you can leave your tampon or menstrual cup in. However, Dr. White explains, \u201cIf a tampon or menstrual cup is in place during sex, it can prevent vaginal insertion for sex and make sex uncomfortable for you and your partner,\u201d says Dr. White. So don\u2019t be embarrassed if you need to make a quick dash to the bathroom to remove one of these items first. Try different positions Asyour hormones fluctuate during your period, it\u2019s typical to feel a little bit different, and what feels good at other points in your cycle may be painful or feel too intense. \u201cIf it is uncomfortable forthe cervixto be hit during sex due to menstrual cramps or being on your period, changing sexual positions to reposition your cervix and uterus can be helpful,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cDepending on how you position your body, the cervix can sit higher or lower in the uterus. For example, bending forward may push the cervix farther away (higher in the vagina).\u201d Consider lying on your side and your partner entering you from a spooning position or straddling them so you can control the depth. Use a period tracker If you\u2019ve noticed changes to your sex drive or sensitivity while you\u2019re on your period, or at any time of the month for that matter, it can be useful and interesting to jot them down in a period tracker. Over time,tracking your cyclecan help you learn more about yourmenstrual cycleand when sex is most enjoyable for you. You can also use ourperiod calculatorto figure out when you\u2019re next due. More FAQs Does period sex feel good? As Dr. White explains, some people find they desire sex more or have an increased sensitivity during their period. And sex itself can feel different during your period, as you may feelpremenstrual symptoms. But everyone\u2019s different, so whether period sex feels good for you is something only you can decide. How can I be intimate on my period?

Take a quiz Possible consequences of period sex Mess When it comes to period sex, a little bit of mess comes with the territory. And this isn\u2019t something you or your partner should be scared of or grossed out by. Period blood is totally natural and safe.

Did you know that your sex drive depends on the cycle phase you\u2019re in? Tips for enjoyable period sex Whether you\u2019d rather do it in the shower, on a towel, or focus solely on oral sex, period sex can look different for everyone. However, sex should always be enjoyable, and both you and your partner should be on the same page with what you\u2019re comfortable with. If you aren\u2019t sure how to approach period sex, there are a few things you can consider. Communicate with your partner So much enjoyment in sex comes from communicating with your partner beforehand. Knowing what your partner likes and feels comfortable with can make sex so much better. Period sex is no exception to this. If you know you\u2019d like to have sex at this time in your cycle, then chat with your partner about it to make sure you\u2019re both on the same page. You\u2019ll feel more relaxed knowing that you\u2019re both excited to try it.

So if you have unprotected sex during your period and ovulate shortly afterward, you would be able to get pregnant. Prepare yourself for a little mess The word mess has a lot of negative connotations, and there\u2019s still some stigma attached to period sex because there may be blood involved. The truth is your period is nothing to be ashamed of, and period blood is safe. However, for the sake of your favorite sheets, you might want to prepare for sex during this time in your cycle. You might choose to have sex in the shower, so any blood washes away. You could also put a large, dark-colored towel on your sheets to catch any blood. You could also use an old set of sheets to save wear and tear on your favorite linens. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the moment, so try to remember to take any menstrual products out before having sex (unless you\u2019re using a menstrual disc). While you\u2019ll need to remove a tampon or menstrual cup before penetrative sex, some people choose to keep them in during foreplay. Remove your tampon or menstrual cup As things start to get heated, you might feel most comfortable keepingyour period productin until just before you have penetrative sex. If you decide that you\u2019d like to stick to oral sex during your period, then you can leave your tampon or menstrual cup in. However, Dr. White explains, \u201cIf a tampon or menstrual cup is in place during sex, it can prevent vaginal insertion for sex and make sex uncomfortable for you and your partner,\u201d says Dr. White. So don\u2019t be embarrassed if you need to make a quick dash to the bathroom to remove one of these items first. Try different positions Asyour hormones fluctuate during your period, it\u2019s typical to feel a little bit different, and what feels good at other points in your cycle may be painful or feel too intense. \u201cIf it is uncomfortable forthe cervixto be hit during sex due to menstrual cramps or being on your period, changing sexual positions to reposition your cervix and uterus can be helpful,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cDepending on how you position your body, the cervix can sit higher or lower in the uterus. For example, bending forward may push the cervix farther away (higher in the vagina).\u201d Consider lying on your side and your partner entering you from a spooning position or straddling them so you can control the depth. Use a period tracker If you\u2019ve noticed changes to your sex drive or sensitivity while you\u2019re on your period, or at any time of the month for that matter, it can be useful and interesting to jot them down in a period tracker.
